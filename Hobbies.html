Love to take photos and videos on my camera. The type of camera I have is a Canon EOS M50. It is good for taking photos and making videos. Like to upload my photos and videos on my MacBook Pro. Enjoy playing around with iMovie, but I am still learning how to edit videos. Eventually, want to learn how to edit photos as well.

Creative writing is fun, I enjoy writing essays and stories. Building a storyline and using different vocabulary words interests me. Plan to write children books and online stories as I progress in my career and hobbies.

My favorite soap opera to watch is The Bold and the Beautiful. This is the only show I watch other than movies. This soap opera is so entrancing to me because I can relate to the different storylines and characters. The background music from the different scenes is nice. Music is something I enjoy because I have been playing different instruments, dancing, singing, and acting throughout my life. The show consists of family, business, fashion, romance, and drama. The characters use different vocabulary words in the show, and I enjoy the context.
