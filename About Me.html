<p>
Have a son named, Noah Gabriel. He is very smart, loves to laugh, sing, run, play on the playground equipment at school or the park, climb trees, watch television, and play on the iPad. His favorite superhero is Spider-Man. Noah loves to help me out with anything. He is so independent and already has great character and boundaries at such a young age.

Noah and I take photoshoots every year to document our lives. We enjoy talking, laughing, singing, dancing, watching television, going to the park, making memories, and enjoying our time together. My son makes me so happy, and I love making beautiful memories with him.
